        <p>
          I'm a Web Developer in the making, hoping to contribute to the hopeful
          future of web apps and interactivity and accessibilty on the web. I'm
          willing to bet on the logitivety of the web, so I'll die on this ship.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don't really have an eye for design, so I'm hoping to nail down the
          technical knowledge to earn me a seat somewhere. I'm wildly fascinated
          by the possibility of making things that leave entirely on the
          internet rather than native apps. I'm inspired by Web Applications
          like Figma, Canva and what they enable all entirely on the Web.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm hoping to be among those that'll crest their name as a pioneer and
          patrons in the Web Application development of the internet by bringing
          even better features and enabling the Web Applications match and even
          surpass what native desktop and mobile apps can do.
        </p>
        <p class="lastchild">
          Less really is more. As Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry said in Airman's
          Odyssey: Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to
          add, but when there is nothing left to take away. Design is
          communication and design is implicit. In my opinion, there is simply
          no other way to do this. This is what I'm here to do; finding the
          essence of things, and to making them shine.
